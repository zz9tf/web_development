# what your app does and how to use it (with screenshots)

## Zheng's Web

This project created a web for myself. If you want to run this project, you need to run this locally or create your own mongodb_URI to run it.

### Home page

This is a home page discriptes my own situation.

### Edite model

The special idea of this web is I try to modify my web through web instead of changing original web code, which gives this web more flexibility.

#### Login

At first I need to login, otherwise I cannot modify this web (Since I obviously don't hope any other people change my website.) The password will be 123456 if you don't have any security.json to save password. Or you can create one for safety.

#### Changed Home page

Then the home page changed, which likes this.

Through submit, I can add more message on my website. And I also can sort these message by add [num] before the context. The message will be automatically sorted themselves through the number.
